          <h2 class="p1">Exersice</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            "Dogs need exercise to burn calories, stimulate their minds, and
            stay healthy. Individual exercise needs vary based on breed or breed
            mix, sex, age and level of health. Exercise also tends to help dogs
            avoid boredom, which can lead to destructive behaviors. Supervised
            fun and games will satisfy many of your pet's instinctual urges to
            dig, herd, chew, retrieve and chase." (ASPCA)
          </p>
          <h2 class="p1">Handling</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            "To carry a puppy or small dog, place one hand under the dog's
            chest, with either your forearm or other hand supporting the hind
            legs and rump. Never attempt to lift or grab your puppy or small dog
            by the forelegs, tail or back of the neck. If you do have to lift a
            large dog, lift from the underside, supporting his chest with one
            arm and his rear end with the other." (ASPCA)

          <h2 class="p1">Fleas & Ticks</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            "Daily inspections of your dog for fleas and ticks during the warm
            seasons are important. Use a flea comb to find and remove fleas.
            There are several new methods of flea and tick control. Speak to
            your veterinarian about these and other options." (ASPCA)

          <h2 class="p1">Medecines & Poisons</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            "Never give your dog medication that has not been prescribed by a
            veterinarian. If you suspect that your animal has ingested a
            poisonous substance, call your veterinarian." (ASPCA)

          <h2 class="p1">Dental Care</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            "Regularly brushing your dog's teeth, along with a healthy diet and
            plenty of chew toys, can go a long way toward keeping her mouth
            healthy. Bacteria and plaque-forming foods can cause build-up on a
            dog's teeth. This can harden into tartar, potentially causing
            gingivitis, receding gums and tooth loss. Many pooches show signs of
            gum disease by the time they're four years old because they aren't
            provided with proper mouth care." (ASPCA)
          </p>

          <h2 class="p1">Eye Care</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            "Giving your pup regular home eye exams will help keep you alert to
            any tearing, cloudiness or inflammation that may indicate a health
            problem. First, face your dog in a brightly lit area and look into
            his eyes. They should be clear and bright, and the area around the
            eyeball should be white. The pupils should be equal in size and
            there shouldn’t be tearing, discharge or any crust in the corners of
            his eyes. With your thumb, gently roll down your dog’s lower eyelid
            and look at the lining. It should be pink, not red or white."
            (ASPCA)
          </p>

          <h2 class="p1">Paw Care</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            "The pads on the bottom of your pups feet provide extra cushioning
            to help protect bones and joints from shock, provide insulation
            against extreme weather, aid walking on rough ground and protect
            tissue deep within the paw. It’s important to check your pet’s feet
            regularly to make sure they’re free of wounds, infections or foreign
            objects that can become lodged." (ASPCA)

          <p class="p1">
            "If you’re responsible caring for puppies in the first few months of
            their lives, you’ll need to be prepared to move them from a diet of
            mom’s milk to regular puppy food. This process of gradually reducing
            a puppy’s dependency on his mother’s milk, known as weaning, should
            generally begin between three and four weeks of age and is ideally
            completely by the time the puppy is seven to eight weeks." (ASPCA)
          </p>

          <h2 class="p1">Feeding Your Adult Dog</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            "Adult dogs require sufficient nutrients to meet energy needs and to
            maintain and repair body tissues. The amount you feed your adult dog
            should be based on his or her size and energy output. Activity
            levels may vary dramatically between pets, and will play an
            important role in determining caloric intake." (ASPCA)
          </p>

          <h2 class="p1">Feeding Your Senior Dog</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            "Dogs begin to show visible age-related changes at about seven to 12
            years of age. There are metabolic, immunologic and body composition
            changes, too. Some of these may be unavoidable while others can be
            managed with diet. When feeding your older dog, the main objective
            should be to maintain health and optimum body weight, slow
            development of chronic disease and minimize diseases that may
            already be present." (ASPCA)
