          <h2 class="p1">Scratching</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            "Cats need to scratch! When a cat scratches, the old outer nail
            sheath is pulled off and the sharp, smooth claws underneath are
            exposed. Cutting your cat’s nails every two to three weeks will keep
            them relatively blunt and less likely to harm the arms of both
            humans and furniture. Provide your cat with a sturdy scratching
            post, at least three feet high. The post should also be stable
            enough that it won't wobble during use, and should be covered with
            rough material such as sisal, burlap or tree bark. Many cats also
            like scratching pads." (ASPCA)
          </p>

          <h2 class="p1">Housing</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            "Your pet should have her own clean, dry place in your home to sleep
            and rest. Line your cat's bed with a soft, warm blanket or towel. Be
            sure to wash the bedding often. Please keep your cat indoors.
            Outdoor cats do not live as long as indoor cats. Outdoor cats are at
            risk of trauma from cars, or from fights with other cats, raccoons
            and free-roaming dogs. Coyotes are known to eat cats. Outdoor cats
            are more likely to become infested with fleas or ticks, as well as
            contract infectious diseases." (ASPCA)
          </p>

          <h2 class="p1">Identification</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            "If allowed outdoors, your cat must wear a safety collar and an ID
            tag. A safety collar with an elastic panel will allow your cat to
            break loose if the collar gets caught on something. And for both
            indoor and outdoor cats, an ID tag or an implanted microchip can
            help ensure that your cat is returned if he or she becomes lost."

          <h2 class="p1">Shedding</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            "Shedding is a cat’s natural process of losing dead hair. Indoor
            cats can shed all year-round. Regularly grooming your cat and
            vacuuming hair from your house should minimize the inconvenience of
            shedding. However, if you see bald patches in your cat’s fur or
            notice a significant loss of hair, the underlying cause may be a
            health-related problem." (ASPCA)
          </p>

          <h2 class="p1">Ear Care</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            "Your cat’s ears may be able to pick up the sound of a bag of treats
            being opened across the house, but they could still use a little
            help staying clean. Monitoring your kitty’s ears once per week for
            wax, debris and infection will help those sensitive sonar detectors
            stay perky and alert to your every move." (ASPCA)
          </p>

          <h2 class="p1">Paw & Nail Care</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            "Cats need healthy feet to scratch, climb and achieve their famed
            acrobatic landings. That’s why it’s important to regularly examine
            your cat’s paws and make sure they’re wound-free." (ASPCA)
          </p>

          <h2 class="p1">Dental Care</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            "Your cat needs clean, sharp teeth and healthy gums. Damage to the
            tongue, teeth, palate and gums can lead to many health risks for
            felines, but these can be prevented with regular home check-ups and
            good old-fashioned brushings." (ASPCA)

          <h2 class="p1">Weaning & Feeding a Kitten</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            "Weaning is the process of transitioning kittens from mother’s milk
            to solid food. During weaning, kittens gradually progress from
            dependence on a mother’s care to social independence. Ideally,
            weaning is handled entirely by the mother cat. However, if the
            kitten in your care has been separated from his mother or if you are
            fostering a litter or a pregnant cat about to give birth, seeing the
            young ones through a successful weaning process may be up to you."

          <h2 class="p1">Feeding Adult Cats</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            "Adult cats should eat enough of a high-quality, nutritious food to
            meet their energy needs and to maintain and repair body tissues. The
            amount you feed your adult cat should be based on his or her size
            and energy output. Activity levels vary dramatically between pets
            and will play an important role in determining caloric intake."

          <h2 class="p1">Feeding Senior Cats</h2>
          <p class="p1">
            "Cats begin to show visible age-related changes at about seven to
            twelve years of age. There are metabolic, immunologic and body
            composition changes, too. Some of these are unavoidable. Others can
            be managed with diet." (ASPCA)
